## Local Setup

### Prerequisites:

- Have mysql installed locally
- Have node installed locally
- Have git installed locally

### 1. Set up database

1. Login to mysql with `mysql -u <username> -p` on your terminal
   - enter password when prompted
2. create a database `create database my_db;`

### 2. Clone repository

1. run `git clone https://github.com/chadgoh/govtech-node-mysql.git` in to your directory of choice
2. Create an .env.local file in project root

   1. `cd dcube`
   2. `touch .env.local`
   3. paste the following fields and fill in mysql username and password

   ```txt
   HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=<username>
   DB_PASSWORD=<password>
   DB_NAME=my_db
   DROP_CREATE=true #
   ```

   > DROP_CREATE true means that, on start up, the database will automatically drop and create the tables if they already exist. Change to false if you want the data to persist.

3. Install dependencies and run local script
   1. In the project root folder, run `npm install`
   2. Run `npm run local` to start up a local instance of the server and you're ready to go.

## User Stories with added assumptions.

### 1. As a teacher, I want to register one or more students to a specified teacher.

A teacher can register multiple students. A student can also be registered to multiple teachers.

- Endpoint: `POST https://govtech-node-mysql.herokuapp.com/api/register`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Success response status: HTTP 204
- Assumptions:

  - Teacher has to exist before registering students.
  - Students have to exist before registering students.
  - Given students cannot already be registered to the given teacher.

- Request body example:

```

{
"teacher": "teacherken@gmail.com"
"students":
[
"studentjon@gmail.com",
"studenthon@gmail.com"
]
}

```

### 2. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students common to a given list of teachers (i.e. retrieve students who are registered to ALL of the given teachers).

- Endpoint: `GET https://govtech-node-mysql.herokuapp.com/api/commonstudents`
- Success response status: HTTP 200
- Request example 1: `GET /api/commonstudents?teacher=teacherken%40gmail.com`
- Success response body 1:

```

{
"students" :
[
"commonstudent1@gmail.com",
"commonstudent2@gmail.com",
"student_only_under_teacher_ken@gmail.com"
]
}

```

- Request example 2: `GET https://govtech-node-mysql.herokuapp.com/api/commonstudents?teacher=teacherken%40gmail.com&teacher=teacherjoe%40gmail.com`
- Success response body 2:

```

{
"students" :
[
"commonstudent1@gmail.com",
"commonstudent2@gmail.com"
]
}

```

### 3. As a teacher, I want to suspend a specified student.

- Endpoint: `POST https://govtech-node-mysql.herokuapp.com/api/suspend`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Success response status: HTTP 204
- Assumptions:
  - Cannot suspend an already suspended student.
- Request body example:

```

{
"student" : "studentmary@gmail.com"
}

```

### 4. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students who can receive a given notification.

A notification consists of:

- the teacher who is sending the notification, and
- the text of the notification itself.

To receive notifications from e.g. 'teacherken@gmail.com', a student:

- MUST NOT be suspended,
- AND MUST fulfill _AT LEAST ONE_ of the following:
  1. is registered with â€œteacherken@gmail.com"
  2. has been @mentioned in the notification

The list of students retrieved should not contain any duplicates/repetitions.

- Endpoint: `POST https://govtech-node-mysql.herokuapp.com/api/retrievefornotifications`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Success response status: HTTP 200
- Request body example 1:

```

{
"teacher": "teacherken@gmail.com",
"notification": "Hello students! @studentagnes@gmail.com @studentmiche@gmail.com"
}

```

- Success response body 1:

```

{
"recipients":
[
"studentbob@gmail.com",
"studentagnes@gmail.com",
"studentmiche@gmail.com"
]
}

```

In the example above, studentagnes@gmail.com and studentmiche@gmail.com can receive the notification from teacherken@gmail.com, regardless whether they are registered to him, because they are @mentioned in the notification text. studentbob@gmail.com however, has to be registered to teacherken@gmail.com.

- Request body example 2:

```

{
"teacher": "teacherken@gmail.com",
"notification": "Hey everybody"
}

```

- Success response body 2:

```

{
"recipients":
[
"studentbob@gmail.com"
]
}

```

```

```
