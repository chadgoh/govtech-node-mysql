### 4. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students who can receive a given notification.

A notification consists of:

- the teacher who is sending the notification, and
- the text of the notification itself.

To receive notifications from e.g. 'teacherken@gmail.com', a student:

- MUST NOT be suspended,
- AND MUST fulfill _AT LEAST ONE_ of the following:
  1. is registered with â€œteacherken@gmail.com"
  2. has been @mentioned in the notification

The list of students retrieved should not contain any duplicates/repetitions.

- Endpoint: `POST https://govtech-node-mysql.herokuapp.com/api/retrievefornotifications`
- Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
- Success response status: HTTP 200
- Request body example 1:

```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hello students! @studentagnes@gmail.com @studentmiche@gmail.com"
}
```

- Success response body 1:

```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@gmail.com",
      "studentagnes@gmail.com",
      "studentmiche@gmail.com"
    ]
}
```

In the example above, studentagnes@gmail.com and studentmiche@gmail.com can receive the notification from teacherken@gmail.com, regardless whether they are registered to him, because they are @mentioned in the notification text. studentbob@gmail.com however, has to be registered to teacherken@gmail.com.

- Request body example 2:

```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@gmail.com",
  "notification": "Hey everybody"
}
```

- Success response body 2:

```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@gmail.com"
    ]
}
```
